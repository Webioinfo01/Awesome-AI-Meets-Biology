We introduce AgentMol, a modular multimodel AI system that integrates large language models, chemical language modeling, and deep learning\u2013based affinity prediction to automate the discovery pipeline. AgentMol begins with disease-related queries processed through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system using the Large Language Model to identify protein targets. Protein sequences are then used to condition a GPT-2\u2013based chemical language model, which generates corresponding small-molecule candidates in SMILES format. Finally, a regression convolutional neural network (RCNN) predicts the drug-target interaction by estimating binding affinities (pKi). Models were trained and validated on 470,560 ligand\u2013protein pairs from the BindingDB database. The chemical language model achieved high validity (1.00), uniqueness (0.96), and diversity (0.89), whereas the RCNN model demonstrated robust predictive performance with R2 > 0.6 and Pearson\u2019s R > 0.8. By leveraging LangGraph for orchestration, AgentMol delivers a scalable, interpretable pipeline, effectively enabling the end-to-end generation and evaluation of drug candidates conditioned on protein targets. This system represents a significant step toward practical AI-driven molecular discovery with accessible computational demands.",

In a Phase II ketamine trial for treatment-resistant depression (n\u2009=\u200963), NetraAI analyzed psychiatric scale data (175/patient) and MRI-derived features (185/patient). NetraAI outperformed traditional machine learning (ML) models in predicting treatment outcomes, improving predictive accuracy by approximately 25-30% and achieving higher sensitivity and specificity in detecting responders. NetraAI identified a 10-clinical variable model that improved predictive AUC by 0.32 over standard machine learning (ML) models and an 8-MRI feature model achieving 95% accuracy and 100% specificity. These findings demonstrate that an explainable dynamical AI approach can leverage small but rich datasets to uncover hidden clinically meaningful subgroups.

The role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in providing nutritional information is increasingly prominent, but its reliability in this domain is not well-established yet. This study compares the nutrition knowledge of state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM)-based conversational agents and chatbots with that of human subjects having different levels of nutrition knowledge. The \u201cGeneral Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire\u2013Revised\u201d (GNKQ-R) was administered to four LLMs (ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, Google Bard, currently known as Google Gemini, and Microsoft Copilot), using zero-shot prompts. Responses were scored in accordance with the GNKQ-R\u2019s guidelines. The average performance of AI systems across all LLMs was 77.3\u2009\u00b1\u20095.1 out of 88, comparable to that of dietetics students and significantly higher than English students. ChatGPT-4 scored highest among the LLMs (82/88), surpassing both groups of students (dietetics: 79.3/88, English: 67.7/88) as well as all other demographic groups. In \u201cDietary Recommendations\u201d, ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 demonstrated comparable performance to dietetics students. ChatGPT-4 excelled in \u201cFood Groups\u201d, outperforming all human groups. In \u201cHealthy Food Choices\u201d, ChatGPT-4 achieved a perfect score, indicating a deep understanding of this subject. ChatGPT-3.5 excelled in \u201cDiet, Disease and Weight Management\u201d. Variations in the performances of the LLMs across different sections were observed, suggesting knowledge gaps in certain areas. Some of the tested LLMs, particularly ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4, showed proficiency in nutrition knowledge, rivaling or even surpassing dietetics students in certain sections. This indicates their potential utility in nutritional guidance. However, this study also identified nuances and specific details where LLMs lack compared to specialized human education. The study highlights the potential of AI in public health and educational settings. However, LLMs may be limited in their capacity to generate personalized dietary advice that accounts for clinical complexity and individual variability, reinforcing the indispensable role of expert human judgment.",

Neurovascular imaging modalities, including magnetic resonance angiography, computed tomography angiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography, remain central for detecting stenosis, aneurysms, occlusions, and arteriovenous malformations. This review synthesizes recent advances in artificial intelligence-augmented stroke care, spanning the continuum from diagnosis to intervention. We first examine artificial intelligence applications in diagnosis, including classification, object detection, and segmentation models that automate lesion localization and subtype identification across multimodal imaging. Advanced architectures, such as convolutional neural networks, transformers, and large language models, are assessed for their potential in multimodal stroke analysis. Beyond diagnosis, we discuss emerging artificial intelligence-driven planning frameworks, extended reality simulators for training and intraoperative guidance, and robotic platforms that enable precise catheter navigation, force sensing, and telerobotic operation. While most systems remain at preclinical or feasibility stages, their integration illustrates a roadmap toward intelligent, multimodal platforms for stroke care. We also highlight key translational and ethical challenges, including regulatory and policy considerations, which must be addressed for safe adoption. Together, these developments point toward a future of precision-driven and globally accessible neurovascular intervention.",

However, the development of artificial intelligence (AI) models for cytology-based diagnostics remains constrained by limited data availability and stringent privacy regulations. This study aims to develop COIN, a controllable cytology image generation foundation model, to address these challenges by synthesizing high-quality cytology images for enhancing AI diagnostics and supporting clinical applications.\n\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN\nThe COIN model was trained on a large-scale dataset of 112,226 cytology image-report pairs from 16 anatomical sites. Using diagnostic textual reports, it generates high-fidelity cytology images with morphologically and semantically coherent features. Expert cytologists evaluated the generated images for anatomical and diagnostic authenticity. The model's utility was assessed through data augmentation experiments, AI model training under data-scarce conditions, and content-based image retrieval applications.\n\n\nRESULTS\nExpert evaluations confirmed the high anatomical and diagnostic fidelity of the images generated by COIN. When used for data augmentation, COIN significantly improved the performance of diagnostic AI models across various tasks. Under data-scarce conditions, models trained exclusively on COIN-generated images demonstrated effective generalization to real-world datasets. Furthermore, COIN supported content-based image retrieval, offering a novel tool for case referencing and clinical decision support.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCOIN represents a robust and privacy-preserving framework for scalable cytology data generation. Its ability to synthesize realistic images and enhance AI diagnostics highlights its broad applicability in computational pathology, providing a valuable tool to accelerate the development and implementation of AI-based diagnostic solutions.",

Additionally, Chang7-2 serves as a valuable model inbred line for genetic and genomic studies, facilitating the discovery of genes underlying hybrid vigor and other agronomic traits. Here, a reference genome assembly and a chemical-induced mutant population (N\u2009=\u20091,716) through ethyl methyl sulfonate (EMS) treatments are generated using Chang7-2. Each EMS line is whole genome sequenced and compared to the Chang7-2 genome, identifying 2,586,769 mutations with 4,939 mutations causing premature stop codons or altered splicing sites. The effect estimation of mutations using two large language artificial intelligence (AI) models, namely the protein language model ESM1b and the DNA language model PlantCaduceus, reveals 15,264 and 18,326 deleterious mutations, respectively. Mutation effects estimated with AI models accelerate revelation of four causal mutations underlying phenotypes of albino leaf, reduced cuticular wax, altered seed color, and male sterility. In addition, allelic expression quantification of genic mutations in 13 EMS M1 lines and their M2 heterozygous progeny, which contain both wildtype and mutant alleles, shows that mutant alleles are overall accumulated at a lower level compared to wildtype. Such allelic disparity is observed for some synonymous mutations, indicating they may not be biologically inconsequential. AI-based estimation of mutation effects offers cross-species evidence for functional impacts of mutations. Our study demonstrates its application in revealing deleterious EMS mutations and identifying causal mutations responsible for mutant phenotypes.",
